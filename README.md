## Todo

- [ ] reveal state after loss needs to show clicked bomb and not show the adjacent cells
- [x] better event handling for clicking for mobile
- [ ] quick reveal mode
- [x] color adjacent counts
- [x] store best time for each difficulty
- [x] disable clicking on flagged items
- [ ] use custom svgs, not emojis
- [x] reveal should not reveal a flagged mine
- [x] add custom hook to handle long press
- [x] usePressHandler should not fire the event if the user drags
- [x] fix right clicking
- [x] update focus styling
- [x] animate mine placement
- [x] fix mobile layout
- [x] lock the game once you're in a win state (currently the user can click an unflagged mine and move from a win to a loss)
- [ ] improve UX on clicking quick -- currently some clicks are being lost
